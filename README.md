## Hey code lovers! 👋

I’m Tatiana Barros, a DevRel Manager at Meteor Software and a Developer  enthusiast. As a neurodivergent woman, I like to share my insights on the challenges of working in the IT field, especially how to overcome imposter syndrome. I also create self-taught study frameworks and mentor people who want to transition to the tech sector.

I’m passionate about generative AI and I’m deepening my knowledge in this area, with a special interest in Github Copilot and other AI tools for coding. I’m also intrigued by creative coding, Processing, p5.js, and JavaScript animation libraries.

In my spare time, I enjoy walking on the beach, watching sci-fi movies or shows, writing about fictional worlds using worldbuilding techniques, and discovering different culinary cultures. I love creating content and I plan to resume my live coding sessions on my Twitch TV channel, where I focus on CSS3, the JavaScript ecosystem, and interactive art projects.
